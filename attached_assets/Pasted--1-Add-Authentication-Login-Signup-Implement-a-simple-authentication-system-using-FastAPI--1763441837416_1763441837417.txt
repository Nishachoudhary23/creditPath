✔️ 1. Add Authentication (Login + Signup)

Implement a simple authentication system using:

FastAPI backend

SQLite or JSON file for user storage

Password hashing (bcrypt)

JWT token-based login

Frontend login & signup using popup modals (not separate pages)

Requirements:

If user is not logged in → redirect to login popup

If login successful → redirect to Dashboard page

Popup UI Requirements:

Modern clean modal

Input: email + password

For signup: name + email + password

✔️ 2. Create Dashboard Page

After login, user goes to:
/dashboard

Dashboard must include:

Navigation sidebar:

Single Prediction (default page)

Batch Prediction

About

Logout

When dashboard loads → show Single Prediction section automatically

✔️ 3. Single Prediction (Already Built)

Keep my existing single prediction but move it into:
dashboard/single.html

When user submits form → call /predict API.

Show:

Probability

Risk Category

Recommendation

Color-coded output card

✔️ 4. Batch Prediction

Create a new page:
dashboard/batch.html

This page must allow:

Upload Excel file (.xlsx)

Send it to /predict_batch API

Backend reads file using pandas

Predict for every row

Return JSON list of predictions

Frontend displays results in a table:

Columns:

Row Number

Probability

Risk Level

Recommendation

Allow user to download results as .xlsx also.

✔️ 5. About Page

Create:
dashboard/about.html

Include:

Project overview (from my PDF)

Model metrics (hardcoded):
